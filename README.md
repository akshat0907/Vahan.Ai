_**ðŸ“š AI Research Paper Summarizer & Podcast Generator**_

This project is a multi-agent AI system that allows users to:

- Search academic papers by topic (arXiv)

- Upload their own research paper (PDF)

- Classify the paper topic

- Generate an easy-to-understand summary

- Synthesize multiple paper summaries

- Create a podcast-style audio from the summary

_**ðŸš€ Features**_

- Topic-Based Search: Enter a research topic and fetch top relevant papers.

- PDF Upload: Analyze your own academic paper by uploading a file.

- Topic Classification: Classifies content against a user-provided list of domains (e.g., NLP, Robotics).

- Summarization: Uses Cohere's Command model to create human-readable summaries.

- Cross-Paper Synthesis: Merges insights from multiple papers into one overview.

- Podcast Generation: Converts text into audio using gTTS.

- Citation Preview: Displays basic metadata (title/source) for traceability.
